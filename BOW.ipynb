    "We are going to practice converting raw (string form) text into a useful data set using the script of *Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl* (2003), the first in a series of PotC movies starring Johnny Depp. The script is part of the `webtext` corpus in NLTK.\n",

These dictionaries could be the data set for a classification task, or for creating a vector-space model for each character, which we will study later in the course. For this assignment, you will clean  up, normalize and tokenize the text, create the dictionaries, and then simply print out the most common words spoken by the\n",
